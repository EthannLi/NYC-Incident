The first I noticed between the two charts are the number of complaints, during the first two months
of the year, there were 265368 complaints while in the summer there were 476401. Furthermore, in the
top 10 in the amount of complaints only, only noise, blocked driveway, illegal parking and water system
were still there. The one huge change was the Heat/Hot Water complaints since the first two months of 
the year was winter and so it is normal for it to be the top complaints. While in the summer, the top 
complaints were noise complaints which is also normal since in the summer there are more outdoors activities
and indoor parties which increases the amount of noise complaints. There was an increase of 100%. One new 
complaint that has appeared is the illegal firework that appears during the summer. 

Conclusion: We can see that there were a lot more 311 interaction in the summer which is intriguing since
it means that during the winter, there are either more police intervention than in the summer, or the usage
of 311 is lessen during winter.
